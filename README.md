## About Me

I am a dedicated software developer with a strong passion for systems programming, performance optimization, and building software that is both reliable and elegant. My technical journey is driven by curiosity, precision, and a deep respect for how computers actually work under the hood.

I specialize in creating solutions that span the entire stack — from low-level systems code in C/C++ to clean, responsive web interfaces with HTML and CSS, automation scripts in Python, and configuration-heavy environments powered by Lua. Every project I touch is approached with the same disciplined mindset: understand the requirements deeply, implement with care, test exhaustively, and refine until the result is stable, maintainable, and performant.

A core part of who I am as a developer is my unwavering commitment to **Gentoo Linux**. The philosophy of Gentoo — compile everything from source, full customization through USE flags, complete transparency, and maximum performance — aligns perfectly with my own values. I don’t just *use* Linux; I live it, tune it, and contribute to my personal ecosystem every day. This environment gives me the control and insight that proprietary or pre-compiled distributions simply cannot match.

Whether I’m optimizing memory usage in C++, scripting complex workflows in Python, ricing my desktop with Lua configs, or containerizing applications with Docker, I bring the same level of attention to detail and long-term thinking to every line of code and every configuration file.

## What I Do – My Development Philosophy

I follow a clear, proven three-stage methodology that guarantees high-quality results:

1. **Build** – Design and implement solutions that are correct by construction, using best practices, clean architecture, and thoughtful abstractions.
2. **Break** – Intentionally stress-test every implementation, hunt down edge cases, performance bottlenecks, race conditions, and unexpected behaviors.
3. **Fix** – Apply elegant, well-researched, maintainable fixes backed by proper debugging tools, documentation, and community knowledge (yes, Stack Overflow is part of the toolkit — but only as one source among many).

This cycle ensures I ship software that doesn’t just “work” — it works *well*, under real-world conditions, for the long term.

## Technical Expertise

### Programming Languages
- **C & C++** — Low-level systems programming, memory management, performance-critical applications, embedded logic, and high-efficiency code.
- **Python** — Rapid scripting, automation pipelines, backend services, data processing, tooling, and DevOps tasks.
- **HTML & CSS** — Semantic, accessible, responsive front-end development with modern standards and pixel-perfect implementations.
- **Lua** — Lightweight configuration scripting, Neovim/awesomewm-style customization, performance-sensitive embedded logic.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Containerization** — Docker for reproducible development environments, microservices, and clean deployment workflows.
- **Version Control** — Git with advanced workflows (rebase, cherry-pick, submodules, clean commit history).
- **Editor & Workflow** — Vim (heavily customized with plugins and keybindings) + Tmux for seamless multitasking and lightning-fast navigation.
- **Build & Package Management** — Gentoo Portage (USE flags, custom ebuilds), Make, CMake.
- **Linux Ecosystem** — Kernel configuration & compilation, system tuning, process management, networking, security hardening.

### Development Practices
- Minimalist, keyboard-driven environments
- Extensive dotfiles management and version control
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Clean, well-documented, testable code
- Reproducible builds and environments

## My Development Environment – The Rig

This is my daily driver setup — carefully riced, minimal, and optimized for maximum productivity and minimal resource usage:
